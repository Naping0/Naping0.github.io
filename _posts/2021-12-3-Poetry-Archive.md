The Poetry Archive is a free web-based library used to save recordings of English poets reading their own works. The archive houses more than 20,000 poems and ensures that the recordings are safe and easy to access so that current and future visitors can enjoy them. Each poet's work is surrounded by contextual information and biography, and has become a valuable resource for anyone looking for poetry.

The site now also includes collections of classic poems being read by contemporary poets and famous voices (including Helen Mirren, Stephen Fry, Judy Dench, and Alan Rickman). When the poet dies without recording, a precious resource is lost forever. As time goes by, the feeling of loss becomes stronger and stronger. By recording poets’ reading of their own works, the Poetry Archives preserves unique and valuable voices for future generations, otherwise these voices may be lost. The collections of the Poetry Archives bring poetry into homes and classrooms, provide valuable educational resources, and protect and preserve an important part of our social and cultural history.

The archive also includes a large amount of materials for teachers and students, including glossaries, biographies, and lesson plans integrated into school resources. And also established a children's poetry website. The Children’s Poetry Archive website for children aged 6-12 includes poems read by poets who wrote poems and poems recorded by others. It also has a "My Profile" function, allowing visitors to create their own playlists, and visitors can search by subject or age group. The benefits of listening to poets reading their own works aloud are far-reaching. Children are born to listen to the rhythm and rhythm of poetry and have fun from it. The Children’s Poetry Archives will ensure that future generations meet children’s needs for poetry.
